Angular bugs #14349, #19199.\\nFor the moment of writing, the only possible way is:\\n:host {\\n  :host-context(...) {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n}\\nIt doesn't work for us because mixin could be called somewhere deeper, like:\\n:host {\\n  p {\\n    @include nb-rtl() { ... }\\n  }\\n}\\nWe are not able to go up to :host level to place content passed to mixin.\\n\\nThe second problem is that we only can be sure that we appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to another\\n:host/:host-context pseudo-class when called in theme files (*.theme.scss).\\n  *\\n    Side note:\\n    Currently, nb-install-component uses another approach where :host prepended with the theme name\\n    (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5b96078624b0a4760f2dbcf6fdf0bd62791be5bb/packages/compiler/src/shadow_css.ts#L441),\\n    but it was made to be able to use current realization of rtl and it can be rewritten back to\\n    :host-context($theme) once we will be able to use multiple shadow selectors.\\n  *\\nBut when it's called in *.component.scss we can't be sure, that selector starts with :host/:host-context,\\nbecause angular allows omitting pseudo-classes if we don't need to style :host component itself.\\nWe can break such selectors, by just appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to them.\\n  ***\\n    Possible solution\\n    check if we in theme by some theme variables and if so append, otherwise nest like\\n    @at-root :host-context([dir=rtl]) {\\n      // add # to scss interpolation statement.\\n      // it works in comments and we can't use it here\\n      {&} {\\n        @content;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    What if :host specified? Can we add space in :host-context(...) :host?\\n    Or maybe add :host selector anyway? If multiple :host selectors are allowed\\n  ***\\n\\n\\nProblems with the current approach.\\n\\n1. Direction can be applied only on document level, because mixin prepends theme class,\\nwhich placed on the body.\\n2. *.component.scss styles should be in :host selector. Otherwise angular will add host\\nattribute to [dir=rtl] attribute as well.\\n\\n\\nGeneral problems.\\n\\nLtr is default document direction, but for proper work of nb-ltr (means ltr only),\\n[dir=ltr] should be specified at least somewhere. ':not([dir=rtl]' not applicable here,\\nbecause it's satisfy any parent, that don't have [dir=rtl] attribute.\\nPrevious approach was to use single rtl mixin and reset ltr properties to initial value.\\nBut sometimes it's hard to find, what the previous value should be. And such mixin call looks too verbose.\\n*/\\n/**\\n * @license\\n * Copyright Akveo. All Rights Reserved.\\n * Licensed under the MIT License.

So we assume they could be combined,\\nlike other pseudo-classes, even same ones.\\nFor example: ':nth-of-type(2n):nth-of-type(even)'.\\n\\nIdeal solution would be to prepend any selector with :host-context([dir=rtl]).\\nThen nebular components will behave as an html element and respond to [dir] attribute on any level,\\nso direction could be overridden on any component level.\\n\\nImplementation code:\\n\\n@mixin nb-rtl() {\\n  // add # to scss interpolation statement.\\n  // it works in comments and we can't use it here\\n  @at-root {selector-append(':host-context([dir=rtl])', &)} {\\n    @content;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nAnd when we call it somewhere:\\n\\n:host {\\n  .some-class {\\n    @include nb-rtl() {\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n:host-context(...) {\\n  .some-class {\\n    @include nb-rtl() {\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nResult will look like:\\n\\n:host-context([dir=rtl]):host .some-class {\\n  ...\\n}\\n:host-context([dir=rtl]):host-context(...) .some-class {\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\n*\\n  Side note:\\n  :host-context():host selector are valid. https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Feb/0305.html\\n\\n  :host-context([dir=rtl]):host-context(...) should match any permutation,\\n  so order is not important.\\n*\\n\\n\\nCurrently, there're two problems with this approach:\\n\\nFirst, is that we can't combine :host, :host-context. Angular bugs #14349, #19199.\\nFor the moment of writing, the only possible way is:\\n:host {\\n  :host-context(...) {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n}\\nIt doesn't work for us because mixin could be called somewhere deeper, like:\\n:host {\\n  p {\\n    @include nb-rtl() { ... }\\n  }\\n}\\nWe are not able to go up to :host level to place content passed to mixin.\\n\\nThe second problem is that we only can be sure that we appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to another\\n:host/:host-context pseudo-class when called in theme files (*.theme.scss).\\n  *\\n    Side note:\\n    Currently, nb-install-component uses another approach where :host prepended with the theme name\\n    (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5b96078624b0a4760f2dbcf6fdf0bd62791be5bb/packages/compiler/src/shadow_css.ts#L441),\\n    but it was made to be able to use current realization of rtl and it can be rewritten back to\\n    :host-context($theme) once we will be able to use multiple shadow selectors.\\n  *\\nBut when it's called in *.component.scss we can't be sure, that selector starts with :host/:host-context,\\nbecause angular allows omitting pseudo-classes if we don't need to style :host component itself.\\nWe can break such selectors, by just appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to them.\\n  ***\\n    Possible solution\\n    check if we in theme by some theme variables and if so append, otherwise nest like\\n    @at-root :host-context([dir=rtl]) {\\n      // add # to scss interpolation statement.\\n      // it works in comments and we can't use it here\\n      {&} {\\n        @content;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    What if :host specified? Can we add space in :host-context(...) :host?\\n    Or maybe add :host selector anyway? If multiple :host selectors are allowed\\n  ***\\n\\n\\nProblems with the current approach.\\n\\n1. Direction can be applied only on document level, because mixin prepends theme class,\\nwhich placed on the body.\\n2. *.component.scss styles should be in :host selector. Otherwise angular will add host\\nattribute to [dir=rtl] attribute as well.\\n\\n\\nGeneral problems.\\n\\nLtr is default document direction, but for proper work of nb-ltr (means ltr only),\\n[dir=ltr] should be specified at least somewhere. ':not([dir=rtl]' not applicable here,\\nbecause it's satisfy any parent, that don't have [dir=rtl] attribute.\\nPrevious approach was to use single rtl mixin and reset ltr properties to initial value.\\nBut sometimes it's hard to find, what the previous value should be.

So we assume they could be combined,\\nlike other pseudo-classes, even same ones.\\nFor example: ':nth-of-type(2n):nth-of-type(even)'.\\n\\nIdeal solution would be to prepend any selector with :host-context([dir=rtl]).\\nThen nebular components will behave as an html element and respond to [dir] attribute on any level,\\nso direction could be overridden on any component level.\\n\\nImplementation code:\\n\\n@mixin nb-rtl() {\\n  // add # to scss interpolation statement.\\n  // it works in comments and we can't use it here\\n  @at-root {selector-append(':host-context([dir=rtl])', &)} {\\n    @content;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nAnd when we call it somewhere:\\n\\n:host {\\n  .some-class {\\n    @include nb-rtl() {\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n:host-context(...) {\\n  .some-class {\\n    @include nb-rtl() {\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nResult will look like:\\n\\n:host-context([dir=rtl]):host .some-class {\\n  ...\\n}\\n:host-context([dir=rtl]):host-context(...) .some-class {\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\n*\\n  Side note:\\n  :host-context():host selector are valid. https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Feb/0305.html\\n\\n  :host-context([dir=rtl]):host-context(...) should match any permutation,\\n  so order is not important.\\n*\\n\\n\\nCurrently, there're two problems with this approach:\\n\\nFirst, is that we can't combine :host, :host-context. Angular bugs #14349, #19199.\\nFor the moment of writing, the only possible way is:\\n:host {\\n  :host-context(...) {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n}\\nIt doesn't work for us because mixin could be called somewhere deeper, like:\\n:host {\\n  p {\\n    @include nb-rtl() { ... }\\n  }\\n}\\nWe are not able to go up to :host level to place content passed to mixin.\\n\\nThe second problem is that we only can be sure that we appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to another\\n:host/:host-context pseudo-class when called in theme files (*.theme.scss).\\n  *\\n    Side note:\\n    Currently, nb-install-component uses another approach where :host prepended with the theme name\\n    (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5b96078624b0a4760f2dbcf6fdf0bd62791be5bb/packages/compiler/src/shadow_css.ts#L441),\\n    but it was made to be able to use current realization of rtl and it can be rewritten back to\\n    :host-context($theme) once we will be able to use multiple shadow selectors.\\n  *\\nBut when it's called in *.component.scss we can't be sure, that selector starts with :host/:host-context,\\nbecause angular allows omitting pseudo-classes if we don't need to style :host component itself.\\nWe can break such selectors, by just appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to them.\\n  ***\\n    Possible solution\\n    check if we in theme by some theme variables and if so append, otherwise nest like\\n    @at-root :host-context([dir=rtl]) {\\n      // add # to scss interpolation statement.\\n      // it works in comments and we can't use it here\\n      {&} {\\n        @content;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    What if :host specified? Can we add space in :host-context(...) :host?\\n    Or maybe add :host selector anyway? If multiple :host selectors are allowed\\n  ***\\n\\n\\nProblems with the current approach.\\n\\n1. Direction can be applied only on document level, because mixin prepends theme class,\\nwhich placed on the body.\\n2. *.component.scss styles should be in :host selector. Otherwise angular will add host\\nattribute to [dir=rtl] attribute as well.\\n\\n\\nGeneral problems.\\n\\nLtr is default document direction, but for proper work of nb-ltr (means ltr only),\\n[dir=ltr] should be specified at least somewhere. ':not([dir=rtl]' not applicable here,\\nbecause it's satisfy any parent, that don't have [dir=rtl] attribute.\\nPrevious approach was to use single rtl mixin and reset ltr properties to initial value.\\nBut sometimes it's hard to find, what the previous value should be.

Angular bugs #14349, #19199.\\nFor the moment of writing, the only possible way is:\\n:host {\\n  :host-context(...) {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n}\\nIt doesn't work for us because mixin could be called somewhere deeper, like:\\n:host {\\n  p {\\n    @include nb-rtl() { ... }\\n  }\\n}\\nWe are not able to go up to :host level to place content passed to mixin.\\n\\nThe second problem is that we only can be sure that we appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to another\\n:host/:host-context pseudo-class when called in theme files (*.theme.scss).\\n  *\\n    Side note:\\n    Currently, nb-install-component uses another approach where :host prepended with the theme name\\n    (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5b96078624b0a4760f2dbcf6fdf0bd62791be5bb/packages/compiler/src/shadow_css.ts#L441),\\n    but it was made to be able to use current realization of rtl and it can be rewritten back to\\n    :host-context($theme) once we will be able to use multiple shadow selectors.\\n  *\\nBut when it's called in *.component.scss we can't be sure, that selector starts with :host/:host-context,\\nbecause angular allows omitting pseudo-classes if we don't need to style :host component itself.\\nWe can break such selectors, by just appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to them.\\n  ***\\n    Possible solution\\n    check if we in theme by some theme variables and if so append, otherwise nest like\\n    @at-root :host-context([dir=rtl]) {\\n      // add # to scss interpolation statement.\\n      // it works in comments and we can't use it here\\n      {&} {\\n        @content;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    What if :host specified? Can we add space in :host-context(...) :host?\\n    Or maybe add :host selector anyway? If multiple :host selectors are allowed\\n  ***\\n\\n\\nProblems with the current approach.\\n\\n1. Direction can be applied only on document level, because mixin prepends theme class,\\nwhich placed on the body.\\n2. *.component.scss styles should be in :host selector. Otherwise angular will add host\\nattribute to [dir=rtl] attribute as well.\\n\\n\\nGeneral problems.\\n\\nLtr is default document direction, but for proper work of nb-ltr (means ltr only),\\n[dir=ltr] should be specified at least somewhere. ':not([dir=rtl]' not applicable here,\\nbecause it's satisfy any parent, that don't have [dir=rtl] attribute.\\nPrevious approach was to use single rtl mixin and reset ltr properties to initial value.\\nBut sometimes it's hard to find, what the previous value should be. And such mixin call looks too verbose.\\n*/\\n/**\\n * @license\\n * Copyright Akveo. All Rights Reserved.\\n * Licensed under the MIT License.

So we assume they could be combined,\\nlike other pseudo-classes, even same ones.\\nFor example: ':nth-of-type(2n):nth-of-type(even)'.\\n\\nIdeal solution would be to prepend any selector with :host-context([dir=rtl]).\\nThen nebular components will behave as an html element and respond to [dir] attribute on any level,\\nso direction could be overridden on any component level.\\n\\nImplementation code:\\n\\n@mixin nb-rtl() {\\n  // add # to scss interpolation statement.\\n  // it works in comments and we can't use it here\\n  @at-root {selector-append(':host-context([dir=rtl])', &)} {\\n    @content;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nAnd when we call it somewhere:\\n\\n:host {\\n  .some-class {\\n    @include nb-rtl() {\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n:host-context(...) {\\n  .some-class {\\n    @include nb-rtl() {\\n      ...\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nResult will look like:\\n\\n:host-context([dir=rtl]):host .some-class {\\n  ...\\n}\\n:host-context([dir=rtl]):host-context(...) .some-class {\\n  ...\\n}\\n\\n*\\n  Side note:\\n  :host-context():host selector are valid. https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2015Feb/0305.html\\n\\n  :host-context([dir=rtl]):host-context(...) should match any permutation,\\n  so order is not important.\\n*\\n\\n\\nCurrently, there're two problems with this approach:\\n\\nFirst, is that we can't combine :host, :host-context. Angular bugs #14349, #19199.\\nFor the moment of writing, the only possible way is:\\n:host {\\n  :host-context(...) {\\n    ...\\n  }\\n}\\nIt doesn't work for us because mixin could be called somewhere deeper, like:\\n:host {\\n  p {\\n    @include nb-rtl() { ... }\\n  }\\n}\\nWe are not able to go up to :host level to place content passed to mixin.\\n\\nThe second problem is that we only can be sure that we appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to another\\n:host/:host-context pseudo-class when called in theme files (*.theme.scss).\\n  *\\n    Side note:\\n    Currently, nb-install-component uses another approach where :host prepended with the theme name\\n    (https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/5b96078624b0a4760f2dbcf6fdf0bd62791be5bb/packages/compiler/src/shadow_css.ts#L441),\\n    but it was made to be able to use current realization of rtl and it can be rewritten back to\\n    :host-context($theme) once we will be able to use multiple shadow selectors.\\n  *\\nBut when it's called in *.component.scss we can't be sure, that selector starts with :host/:host-context,\\nbecause angular allows omitting pseudo-classes if we don't need to style :host component itself.\\nWe can break such selectors, by just appending :host-context([dir=rtl]) to them.\\n  ***\\n    Possible solution\\n    check if we in theme by some theme variables and if so append, otherwise nest like\\n    @at-root :host-context([dir=rtl]) {\\n      // add # to scss interpolation statement.\\n      // it works in comments and we can't use it here\\n      {&} {\\n        @content;\\n      }\\n    }\\n    What if :host specified? Can we add space in :host-context(...) :host?\\n    Or maybe add :host selector anyway? If multiple :host selectors are allowed\\n  ***\\n\\n\\nProblems with the current approach.\\n\\n1. Direction can be applied only on document level, because mixin prepends theme class,\\nwhich placed on the body.\\n2. *.component.scss styles should be in :host selector. Otherwise angular will add host\\nattribute to [dir=rtl] attribute as well.\\n\\n\\nGeneral problems.\\n\\nLtr is default document direction, but for proper work of nb-ltr (means ltr only),\\n[dir=ltr] should be specified at least somewhere. ':not([dir=rtl]' not applicable here,\\nbecause it's satisfy any parent, that don't have [dir=rtl] attribute.\\nPrevious approach was to use single rtl mixin and reset ltr properties to initial value.\\nBut sometimes it's hard to find, what the previous value should be. And such mixin call looks too verbose.\\n*/\\n/**\\n * @license\\n * Copyright Akveo. All Rights Reserved.\\n * Licensed under the MIT License.

Projeto</h2>\\n          <h4 class=\\\"subtitle\\\">Objetivo</h4>\\n          <p>O objetivo deste projeto é analisar a viabilidade do uso da Internet das Coisas em áreas rurais. Para\\n            isso, uma horta inteligente está instalada na Escola Municipal \\\"Mariquinha Capistrano\\\" e é composta por\\n            três culturas de vegetais. Além disto, integra-se ao projeto sensores para monitoração da umidade do solo\\n            de cada cultivo, um sistema de irrigação que permite a irrigação independente de cada canteiro e um sistema\\n            de videomonitoramento de imagens por câmeras. Por fim, têm-se que a comunicação é baseada em redes 5G. </p>\\n          <p>Os dados coletados das hortas são disponibilizados numa plataforma online que permite o acionamento do\\n            sistema de irrigação de acordo com a demanda de cada cultura, a observação da umidade do solo de cada\\n            canteiro e a monitoração em tempo real do videomonitoramento na escola foco.</p>\\n          <p>Com isso, espera-se demonstrar a viabilidade da oferta de serviços IoT em áreas rurais, valendo-se do uso\\n            de redes 5G. O prazo de duração do projeto é de 24 meses.</p>\\n\\n          <h4 class=\\\"subtitle\\\">Resumo</h4>\\n          <p>No intuito de avaliar a utilização das redes 5G para aplicações IoT em áreas rurais, criou-se o projeto\\n            \\\"Internet das Coisas na Área Rural\\\", o qual visa o desenvolvimento de uma horta inteligente na Escola\\n            Municipal \\\"Mariquinha Capistrano\\\". Esta escola é o ambiente de experimentos para validação de pesquisas\\n            realizadas pelos laboratórios de desenvolvimento e pesquisa do Inatel. </p>\\n          <p>A horta está conectada à Internet via a rede 5G desenvolvida pelo Inatel e é composta por um sistema de\\n            monitoramento do nível de umidade dos canteiros, um sistema de irrigação que permite a umidificar cada\\n            canteiro independentemente e um sistema de videomonitoramento.</p>\\n          <p>Com base nas informações obtidas pelo sistema de monitoramento do nível de umidade e de acordo com o tipo\\n            de plantação cultivada, pode-se acionar o sistema de irrigação remotamente. A irrigação é realizada sempre\\n            que necessário, ou seja, quando o sistema de monitoramento informar que o solo esteja seco para determinada\\n            cultura e o usuário realizar a escolha do acionamento da irrigação desejada. </p>\\n          <p>A evolução das plantações poderá ser acompanhada visualmente através de um sistema de câmeras. Os alunos,\\n            professores e funcionários da escola passarão por um treinamento para conhecerem e se ambientarem com as\\n            tecnologias disponibilizadas a eles. Após a implantação do sistema, será realizada uma demonstração às\\n            autoridades governamentais competentes e o controle do aplicativo desenvolvido será entregue aos\\n            responsáveis pela escola.</p>\\n\\n          <h4 class=\\\"subtitle\\\">Etapas</h4>\\n          <p>O presente projeto está implementado na Escola Municipal \\\"Mariquinha Capistrano\\\", situada no bairro\\n            Vintém, na cidade Santa Rita do Sapucaí, MG.</p>\\n          <p>Baseando-se no manual para Escolas - Hortas [1], o qual foi desenvolvido pelo projeto “A escola promovendo\\n            hábitos alimentares saudáveis” e que faz parte do programa de parceria da FUNSAUDE / Departamento de\\n            Nutrição com o Departamento de Política de Alimentação e Nutrição da Secretaria de Políticas de Saúde do\\n            Ministério da Saúde, propõe-se a construção de uma horta inteligente neste local. Deste modo, o\\n            desenvolvimento do projeto será realizado em 6 etapas, sendo elas:</p>\\n          <p>1. Conectividade: para a demonstração inicial, o projeto irá empregar um enlace 5G provido pelo Inatel por\\n            um período de teste de 30 dias. Findada esta etapa, o Inatel irá prover o serviço de acesso à Internet\\n            através de um provedor local, pelo período de 24 meses.</p>\\n          <p>2. Infraestrutura física: o Inatel será responsável por preparar três canteiros para plantio de culturas\\n            distintas, de acordo com as demandas da escola. Os sensores de monitoramento de umidade do solo, o sistema\\n            de irrigação e a infraestrutura para a coleta dos dados também ficarão sob a responsabilidade do Inatel,\\n            assim como a instalação das câmeras de observação da horta. O manejo inicial das plantações será realizado\\n            pelo Inatel, mas os cuidados diários a partir do plantio ficará sob responsabilidade da direção da escola\\n            Mariquinha Capistrano.</p>\\n          <p>3. Treinamento: será realizado um treinamento com os alunos, professores e funcionários da escola para\\n            auxiliá-los no uso do aplicativo que permite a operação da horta inteligente. Esse treinamento terá duração\\n            de 4 horas e será agendado de acordo com a disponibilidade dos participantes.</p>\\n          <p>4. Demonstração: está prevista a demonstração do Projeto Internet das Coisas na Área Rural para as\\n            autoridades governamentais após a instalação da infraestrutura.</p>\\n          <p>5. Testes e validações: a aplicação proposta será testada durante um período de 24 meses e os dados\\n            obtidos serão analisados pela equipe de pesquisa do Inatel. Os alunos, professores e funcionários da escola\\n            Mariquinha Capistrano também terão acesso ao monitoramento e controle da horta.</p>\\n          <p>6. Acompanhamento: esta etapa compreende o acompanhamento e a manutenção da aplicação desenvolvida pelo\\n            Inatel durante um período de 24 meses.</p>\\n\\n          <h4 class=\\\"subtitle\\\">Resultados esperados</h4>\\n          <p>Os principais resultados esperados deste projeto são:</p>\\n          <p>1. Análise de desempenho da rede 5G para áreas remotas em condições reais de operação;</p>\\n          <p>2. Demonstração da viabilidade do uso de IoT em agronegócios;</p>\\n          <p>3. Estimular o uso de tecnologia da informação por parte dos alunos da escola rural;</p>\\n          <p>4. Produção de artigos científicos relevantes para a área.</p>\\n\\n          <h4 class=\\\"subtitle\\\">Conclusões</h4>\\n          <p>A utilização de redes IoT em ambientes rurais tem o potencial de elevar a produtividade do campo, trazendo\\n            grandes benefícios para a sociedade. As redes 5G de longa distância podem ultrapassar a fronteira de\\n            cobertura das redes móveis atuais, levando o acesso à Internet a praticamente qualquer localidade. Por meio\\n            da integração destas duas tecnologias, espera-se que haverá uma verdadeira revolução nas áreas remotas, uma\\n            vez que será possível coletar informações cruciais para o aumento da produtividade rural, além de permitir\\n            que pessoas, hoje desconectadas, passem a usufruir da era digital na qual vivemos hoje.</p>\\n          <p>O caso de uso escolhido para a demonstração da capacidade desta rede de comunicação possui sintonia com as\\n            práticas realizadas em escolas públicas em todo o Brasil, das quais pode-se exemplificar as diversas\\n            iniciativas e projetos de construção de hortas escolares presentes nas referências [2, 3, 4, 5]. Além\\n            disso, são evidentes os inúmeros benefícios e vantagens provenientes da execução destes projetos, tais\\n            como: garantia de segurança alimentar e nutricional dos alunos, redução do gasto com a merenda escolar,\\n            fomento de hábitos de alimentação saudável nas escolas, entre outros. Dessa forma, os resultados previstos\\n            com este projeto contribuem com cinco dos dezessete Objetivos do Desenvolvimento Sustentável, destacados na\\n            Figura 1 e que fazem parte da Agenda da Organização das Nações Unidas (ONU) com metas para o ano de 2030\\n            [6]. </p>\\n          <p>Finalmente, o Projeto \\\"Internet das Coisas na Área Rural\\\" trará contribuições importantes para a validação\\n            de desempenho do transceptor 5G do Inatel, além de demonstrar que a tecnologia está apta para atender as\\n            demandas de áreas rurais.</p>\\n          <div class=\\\"col-md-12 col-lg-12\\\" align=\\\"center\\\">\\n            <img align=\\\"center\\\" src=\\\"../../../assets/images/figura1.jpg\\\" />\\n            <p>Figura 1.
